# Simple ingest job through docker and python

The general idea is to fetch the data for yellow NY taxi and ingest it into a database in pgAdmin.

# Tools
- Docker for containerization
- VS Code for dockerfile, pipeline and python script creation
- Jupyter Notebook for testing code
- pgAdmin for DB
- postgresql/pgcli for SQL

To complete this project, I will store files accordingly through the main branch and use feature branch to make my changes.
